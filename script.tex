\section{Introduction}

Nowadays it is an obivious statement to make that we live in a time in which
technology is ubiquitous and new technology is being developed at an
unprecidented rate. It penetrates our society and is one of the adhesives that
hold 'the system' in place. We must only envision a world in which cars do not
exist; or refrigerators; or the internet; or x-ray machines to see how much of
our (everyday) lives depends and is shaped by it. I also don't think that I go
out on a limb when I say that we integrate some technology relatively fast into
our lives. Iphone in 2007 and a couple years later everybody has a smartphone

Traffic lights are installed and programmed, perhaps superficially supervised
and occasionally maintained and updated. peepee

In this work I will discuss technology and moral responsibility and how the two
relate to each other. Specifically, I will investigate the different ways we can seek
for moral responisbility in situations where an autonomous machine is involved.

Put more here.

But first, let us examine the traditional way of how we ascribe moral
responisbility in situations where technology is involved:

Suppose the following situations: A person hits another person with a hammer and
kills them. A newly installed dam breaks and a city is flooded. A hacker manages
to get access to a digital banking system through his own computer and steals a
good deal of money.\\

The hammer, the dam and the hacker's computer are technology that is directly
involved in morally critical situations. Yet, we abstain from blaming these
artifacts for what has happened in the respective situations. We also do not put
the events off as natural tragedies, as we do when a storm destroys a house or
an avalanche kills a skier in the mountains. We naturally ascribe the
responsibility for the events to the people behind the technology.
The person who wielded the hammer, the architect of the dam, the hacker.
These people used the technology as a tool to achive their own end and they are
responsible for the effects, that the technology has on our world, whether they
achieve the end or (as in the case of the dam-architect) not.
To view technology as tools or instruments used by humans and the humans as the ultimately
responsible entities for the technology is what Heidegger calls the \textit{instrumentalist
definition of technology} (\cite{heidegger1977technology}). 

\say{We ask the question concerning technology when we ask what it is. Everyone
knows the two statements that answer our question. One says: Technology is a means to an end. The
other says: Technology is a human
activity.}(\cite[p.4]{heidegger1977technology})

Thus, according to the instrumentalist definition, technology is something that
is intimately connected to humans and inherits its moral standing from the
quality of the \textit{human} end that it tries to achieve and from the way
it is used by \textit{humans}. Technology is not moral on its own. Only in the
context of human ends and actions. If it is humans that decide to use technlogy
for some end it is naturally them, who are responsible for the results.\\
A very similar line of reasoning is layed out by Sullins in what he calls the user, tool and victim
model (\cite[p. 152]{sullins2006robot}).

In the advent of machine learning we are facing a type of technology that is
intentinally becoming more and more autonomous, making decisions on its own
without any human supervision, without any human being able to predict or at
least explain those decisions. The Machines are essentially black boxes making
decisions and affecting the world in morally significant ways:

Autonomous Vehicles are being developed to populate the streets and naviagte
dangerous situations.
Machine Learning Algorithms analyse our behaviour on the internet, recommend
content that they find we would be interested in and influence us in this
manner.
There is a multitude of applications for ML in health care. We can easily
imagine that medical practitioners will increasingly rely on tools that diagnose
diseases and even propose treatments. Eventually, patients might even cut
out the middle man and receive their medical care from artificial physicians.
There already are services that provide a kind of psychotherapy by texting with
a chatbot. [zitieren]
Autonomous Weapon Systems (\acrshort{aws}) are being developed. The aim is to
create war robots that can be sent into the battle field and they would be able
to decide on their own whether to kill a target or not.

But what is the problem here? Why don't treat the vehicle, the recommender
algorithms, the health care systems, the war robots in just the same way as the
hammer, the dam or the computer from the examples above? Why not again hold the
operator or the manufacturer responsible? What is the difference? Why this
paper?



%Instrumental Theory:

%(\cite{johnson2006computer}): Computers are moral entites but not moral agents
%For most of the time human technology has been used as a tool.
%The user or manufacturer has the responisibility for what the tool does.
%This has been working so far quite well and the instrumental theory was a valid
%and accepted extension of our moral understanding.
%We are now in a time, where new technologies, that exhibit more and more
%autonomy challenge this stance, that they are mere tools. How should we handle
%des question of responisibility with this new technology? Is there are
%responisibility gap?
%
%Introduction of new technologies: ML

\subsection{The Dirty Problem}

The answer for these questions is the challenge that these technologies pose to
our traditional ways of ascribing responsibility.

According to Matthias (\cite{Matthias_2004}) the reason why we can hold either the
manufacturer or the operator of a machine responsible for what it effects in the
world, is because we can sensibly say that they are the moral agents who were in
control of said machine. Matthias claims that responsibility implies control:

\vspace{.8em}
\say{[An] agent can be considered responsible only if he knows the particular
facts surrounding his action, and if he is able to freely form a decision to
act, and to select one of a suitable set of available alternative actions based
on these facts.} (\cite[p.175]{Matthias_2004})

\vspace{.8em}
This means that we can only hold someone responsible for something they have
done if they had sufficient control over their action.
This is widely refered to as the Control Requirement (\acrshort{cr}) [zitieren].

Converesly, if an agent does not have sufficient control, we can acsribe at most
partial responsibility, if any, to them.\\
This notion of control as a precondition for responsibility seems to complement the intrumental theory: The
manufacturer and operator have control over their machines, thus they are the
ones who are responsible if something happens because of the machines.
It is then very clear how to assign responisbility in critical situations: If the operator uses the
machine in accordance with the manufactureres specifications and something goes
wrong, we say that the manufacturer is responsible. If the operator deviates
from the manufacturers specifications and something goes wrong, we say the
operator is responsible (\cite[p.175]{Matthias_2004}).

Enter Machine Learning:
We are now in a time where computer scientists and engineers work on increasing
the autonomy of their programs and machines by using techniques that can be
bundeled by the term \textit{machine learning} (\acrshort{ml}). `Autonomy' in this sense
means that we allow the technology to make it's own decisions based on it's
prior experience without the programmer or user knowing what the decision is
going to be. 

%Put here: Machines can play Go, AWS, medical exper systems, even the youtube
%algorithm

This leads to a change in the classical roles of the manufacturer
(programmer) and operator (user) insofar that the amount of control they exert
over the machines diminishes as the machines become more and more autonomous.
Arguably, our traditional ways of ascribing responsibility are challenged. If we
agree with the CR and 

%Current practices in Artificial Intelligence (\acrshort{ai}) challenge this
%stance. The classical roles of manufacturer (programmer) and operator (user)
%change insofar that the amount of control they exert over the machines
%diminishes as the machines become increasingly autonomous.

%Current practices in Artificial Intelligence (\acrshort{ai}) aim at increasing
%the autonomy of machines and their software [zitieren]. `Autonomy' in this sense
%means that we allow the technology to make it's own decisions based on it's
%prior experience without the programmer or user knowing what the decision is
%going to be. In other words, they reduce the amount of control the programmer or
%user has over the machines. This is primarily the case for technology that uses
%machine learning to acquire a certain behaviour. [Passt hier eine beschreibung
%von machine learning rein?] At the same time the actions of
%such technologies have more and more impact on the people surrounding them
%[zitieren].\\

The real question:
Now here comes the question of this work: Who can sensibly be held responsible for the
actions of an autonomous machine?
Who is responsible if a driverless car runs over a person? Who is responsible if
an artificial physician proposes a wrong treatment for a patient? Who is
responisble for a war crime commited by an autonomous weapon system
(\acrshort{aws})?\footnote{Talk about asymetry of blame and reward. Refer to
later in next section perhaps, because here I mention responisbility only in the
sense of blaming someone}\\

Matthias says that our current practices of ascribing moral responsibility
fail at finding an appropriate target when an autonomous machine is
strongly involved in a situation. He calls this problem \textit{the
responsibility gap}.\\
%are not designed for dealing with autonomous machines and we are, thus, facing
%a responsibility gap. \\

The considerations above, do not entail that our current practices of
dealing with the effects machines have on our world must necessarily change,
but rather that the contemporary and foreseeable developments in AI and ML
challenge our current practices and motivate their reevaluation.

On the following pages I will first give descriptions of various accounts for
moral responsiblity and will then proceed to describing and debating the
different approaches philosophers have proposed for dealing with the assumed
responisbility gap.

%BIS HIER
%
%The idea that manufacturers and users lose control over an autonomous machine
%does not only stem from the theoretical definition of the word 'autonomous'. As
%Matthias argues, the loss of control can be found in the very way we put
%ML-techniques into practice (\cite[p.181-182]{Matthias_2004}). 
%
%Russell and Norvig define an agent as learning 
%
%\vspace{.8em}
%\say{if it improves its performance on future taskes after making observations
%about the real world.}(\cite[p.693]{russell2010artificial})
%
%\vspace{.8em}
%
%Technology that is being developed today often has the aim to become more and
%more autonomous. Autonomous in this sense means that we allow the technology to
%make it's own decisions based on it's prior experience without the programmer or
%user knowing what the decision is going to be. This is primarily the case for
%technology that uses machine learning to acquire a certain behaviour.
%As Matthias (\cite{Matthias_2004}) points out, the growing autonomy challenges our
%existing pracices for ascription of moral responsibility. Matthias says that
%in order to be responsible for something, one requires to be in control of it.
%This widely refered to as the Control Requirement (\acrshort{cr}) [zitieren].
%It follows, that neither the programmer, nor the user of an autonomous machine,
%can sensibly be said to be responsible for the actions of that machine.

\section{The Basics}
\subsection{Two Perspectives}
The process view and the property view.
I would like to introduce an idea by Daniel Tigard, that will serve as very
helpful tool to classify different approaches discribed in this piece. Though
Tigard relates that idea to specifically moral responsibility, I will try to
broaden it's application. The pattern that is unveiled by that idea will follow
us throughout the following pages in different forms and variations, but it is
still unmistakable. When Tigard speaks of models of moral responsibility he
speaks that we may have a \textit{process view} or a \textit{property view} on
it CITATION. While I will examine what that means for moral responsibility with greater
detail later on
DID YOU EXPLAIN IT MISCHA????
, I want to explain what these two possible views shall mean for us.

The two views are lenses that people use to explain some things we attribute to
each other. This seems like a very vague statement but allow me to elaborate:
What are these \say{things} that I mean? Well I mean stuff like consciousness,
moral responsibility, moral agency, intentionality, in short: all of those fine
concepts that philosophers hold so dearly by their hearts. From the property
view then, these things have some sort of metaphysical truth to them. The
subjects that we ascrive these things to, are said to have some kind of real
\textit{property} that gives rise to the thing and our perception of it. Without
this property on cannot truthfully say that the thing is there. Relating to
moral responsibility, Tigard says that \say{\textit{being} responsible [is]
conceptually prior to being \textit{held} responsible.}
To be rightfully held responsible, one must truly be responsible. To be
considered conscious, one mus truly by conscious. On the other hand, we have the
process view. The process view is another way of saying \say{It's a social
construct}. According to it, these things that we ascribe to ourselves and each
other are the results of a process of social and individual negotiation. The
thing is not born from some fundamental property that is there, but from
\textit{being regarded as} existent. \say{\textit{[H]olding} is conceptually
prior to \textit{being} [...]}

of two different views we can have on the
things we will discuss in this piece.
We can have the process view or we can property view on them. This idea stems
from Daniel Tigard and he relates it to specifically moral resp
\subsection{What is Moral Responsibility}

Before jumping into any analysis of the responsibility gap as described above,
it makes sense to first explore what I mean, when I speak of moral
responsibilty. While we generally have an intuitive understanding of what we mean
by (moral) responsibility, it is important for the following discussion to have
a more rigorous account of the term. The necessity of clarifiying the term
becomes clear, when we expose it's ambiguity in our everyday language.
Sometimes we use moral responsibilty to say that someone has some sort of moral
obligation to do something. Sometimes we use the term to say that we blame
someone. Sometimes, to denote that a certain action, attitude or event can be
attributed to someone in a sense that allows us to appraise them on it's basis.
And on and on...
%For one,
%holding someone responsible, often implies that they did something morally
%reprehensible. When we read or hear phrases like \say{I hold you responsible for
%	what you have done
%with the flowers.}, we often infer from that the speaker is blaming the person
%they are speaking with. However, most people would agree that being responsible
%for something does not imply blame. Being responsible can also mean that the
%person is praiseworthy. We can easily say that Florence Nightingale is
%responsible for founding modern nursing, something that people generally praise
%her for.

Angela Smith describes 3 different meanings that the sentence
\say{\textit{A} holds \textit{B} responsible for \textit{X}} can have:
(\cite[p. 469]{Smith_2007}):

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A thinks that B is open to moral appraisal because of X.\\
	\item A thinks that B is culpable and therefore blameworthy because of
		X.\\
	\item A blames B for X.
\end{enumerate}

For the sake of this work we are mostly interested in Smith's first sense of the
sentence. Thus, being responsible for something means that \textit{one is open to moral
appraisal for it}. In other words, when I am responsible for something, it means
that I am an appropriate target of blame, praise or other moral responses
because of it. PERHAPS THIS IS A GOOD MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE IMBALANCE IN R.
As we will see later, the same of very similar definitions of
responsibility can be found in other philosophical works on responsibility. We
will, thus, continue working with it.

%This and similar definitions of responsibility can be found
%repeatedly in philosophical literature.

Now that we have agreed on what we mean when we speak of moral responsibility,
the questions that still remain are: What are the things that we are responsible
for? What are the conditions that need to be fulfilled to be morally responsible
for something (\cite[p. 370]{smith2008control})? Let us take a look at two
accounts that try to answer that question.


NOTE: Criticise MATTHIAS FOR HIS CR. IT is not well defined. What is control. Control
over future choices, past choices, what about situation where one does not have
all the situation. Where does control end and so on.



%It is rather uncommon to use such phrasing to praise

%and far less often in the context of praising. Still, responsibility does not
%necessarily entail negative appraisal. We say that Marie Curie and and Henri
%Becquerel are responsible for discovering radioactivity and are generally
%praised for it.  Angela Smith says that the phrase \say{A holds b responsible
%for X} can mean three different things:

\subsubsection{Strawson}

There is an ongoing discussion in philosophy about the existance of determinism
and it's impact on free will, and some philosophers deem free will to be closely related to
moral responsibility [zitieren]. To discuss this topic is notbla bla nor is it
my intention to take a position on this issue. Instead I will try to elegantly
sidestep the matter by taking a Strawsonian approach on moral responsibility.

PERHAPS I CAN TAKE THAT FIRST PARAGRAPH OUT? NO NEED TO SPEAK OF DETERMINISM.

In ``Freedom and Resentment'' P.F.Strawson gives and account of our moral
practices and tries to explain the mechanisms behind them. These mechanisms lay
the groundwork for what can be understood as moral responsibility.
In the centre of Strawson's argumentation lies \say{the very great importance that
we attach to the attitudes and intetions towards us of other human beings
[...]}(\cite[p.5]{Strawson1962}). In other words, we care a lot about how other
people treat us. We like it, if other people treat us with what we interpret as
respect and goodwill and we do not like it, if other people treat us with what
we interpret as illwill or indifference. Depending on how other people treat us
and which attitudes we ascribe to them, we in turn develop and adjust our own
attitudes towards them. Strawson calls the attitudes we form as a reaction to
other people (quite fittingly) our \textit{reactive
attitudes}. Examples for such attitudes are resentment, indignation, gratitude.
These reactive attitudes form the basis for our practices of blaming and
praising other people.

BEISPIEL EINFÜGEN!!


\begin{example}
	Matt is seventeen and likes playing computer games. His ten year old brother
	Charly often watches him play and frequently asks Matt, if he can play
	too. Matt usually denies Charly's request. Charly finds this unfair
	because Matt can play so much and he can only watch. Charly develops
	slight resentment against his brother because in his eyes, Matt
	does not care enough about him to fulfill Charly's wish of playing.
	Eventually, Charly runs to his mother and complains about Matt's
	unwillingness to allow Charly to play on the computer.
\end{example}

The primitive example above portrays the mechanism, Strawson tries to describe.
In the situation Charly interprets that his brother, Matt, treats him with an
attitude he does not like: indifference. This prompts Charly to develop
resentment towards Matt as a reactive attitude. Charly's going to his mother and
complaining about Matt is his way of blaming Matt.

Strawson stresses the importance of attitude behind an action, for we evaluate
other people and their actions strongly on the basis of their attitudes and
intentions. The same action with different attitudes elicits different reactions
from us. Strawson gives the example of someone stepping on his hand. If P-Boy
found that they did it accidentally and they were sorry for injuring him, he
would feel the pain in his hand, but probably no (appropriate) resentment
towards them. If, on the other hand, he found that they stepped on his hand out
of malevolence or were indifferent to what had happened, Strawsons reaction
would include some kind of resentment towards the other person. The same is
true, for when another person benefits us in some way. The degree of gratitude
we would feel towards them would differ, depending on whether they did it on
purpose and out of good will or accidentally (\cite[p.6]{Strawson1962}).


%Question for Uwe (perhaps): Is the person that steps on P-Boys hand not still
%responsible for doing so? They may not be open to appraisal, but it was still
%them, who did it. Is there an answer to that in Shoemaker? I don't think so.
%Perhaps some people would say that they were then causal

I should also point out, just like Strawson repeatedly does (\cite[p.5,
p.7]{Strawson1962}), that the way reactive attitudes work is much more
complicated than can be explained in this text. There is a complex
interplay between different parties and the attitudes vary on a broad spectrum
as well as in intensity.\\

The type of reactive attitudes I have described until now is generally about close
personal interactions with other people. They develop because of the way other
people treat specifically \textit{us}. 
However, reactive attitudes are not only a personal phenomenon but are also developed
and affected by how the objects of these attitudes treat other people.
Thus, Strawson introduces another class of reactive attitudes, which he calls
\textit{vicarious} or \textit{impersonal} reactive attitudes. These attitudes
target the behaviour or will of others independent of who is affected by them.
To be clear: These impersonal reactive attitudes can also be
developed if \textit{we} are the suffering party, but \say{[...] they are
essentially capable of being vicarious}(\cite[p.15]{Strawson1962})
THE 'TO BE CLEAR' IS NOT AS CLEAR AS IT SHOULD BE.

Strawson proceeds and gives these vicarious reactive attitudes the
qualifier \textit{'moral'} and the objects of such reactive attitudes are said
to have done something that has moral value (positive or negative) to us
(\cite[p.15]{Strawson1962}). And thus, Strawson has linked the concept of
moralitiy with his reactive attitudes.


\begin{example}
	Clara likes to read the newspaper in the morning. Today, she finds an
	article about a CEO of a big international company and how he knowingly
	choses suppliers that violate human rights to drive the price of their
	commodities down. Clara does not like this behaviour.
\end{example}


It is clear that Clara is not personally affected (at least not directly) by the
behaviour of the CEO. She still develops a reactive attitude towards him on the
basis of his indifference regarding humabn rights and the people who suffer
because of it. What Clara experiences is moral indignation.

To sum it all up: According to Strawson, we expect from other people that they
behave in accordance with attitudes of respect and goodwill. Depending on
whether they cohere with these expectations, we exhibit resentment or gratitude
(reactive attitudes) towards them. We blame or praise other people on the basis
of these reactive attitudes. Morality comes into play, when we acknowlidge that
we expect certain behaviour not only towars us, \say{[...] but towards all those on
whose behalf moral indignation may be felt [...]} (\cite[p.16]{Strawson1962}).

In light of this account, moral responsibility is not a metaphysical entity.
From a Strawsonian perspective, to be morally responsible can be interpreted as
being an appropriate object of vicarious reactive attitudes
(\cite[p.3]{SmithVickers2021}) (\cite[p.175]{Matthias_2004}). Tigard takes moral
responsibility in this regard \say{as a social funtion of [...] reactive
attitudes} (\cite[p.3]{Tigard_2020}). 
These definitions cohere very well with the one I already mentioned above: To be
responsible means to be open to moral appraisal.

HERE I MUST FINISH THE DIGRESSION AND EXPLAIN REFERENCE THE INITIAL QUESTION:
WHAT ARE WE RESPONSIBLE FOR?

FIND MORE INTERPRETATIONS AND PUT THEM
INTO CONTEXT

SHOEMAKER SAYS: MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IS, AT LEAST IN PART, BEING OPEN TO A
CERATAIN RANGE OF MORAL RESPONSES (PAGE 11)


Before moving on, Strawson, introduces another idea, which might be important for
our further discussion on the main topic of this work, the responsibility gap.
He describes in which cases reactive attitudes are mitigated or even not
exhibited at all. Strawson distinguishes two general groups of such cases:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Cases of the first group are those where the source of injury is a
		moral agent but their explanation for their action can be
		summarised with the sentences `I didn't know', `I had to do it'
		or something similar (\cite[p.7-8]{Strawson1962}). Tigard
		descibes these cases as situations \say{where the agent is
		normal, but the circumstances are abnormal [...]} 
		(\cite[p.5]{Tigard_2020}).

		Examples of such cases are the gentleman who accidentally steps
		on someones foot because the train is too full and he tries to
		navigate through the crowd, or the doctor who has lost a patient
		and is then rude to her husband. The people who suffer the
		injury usually tend to modify their reactive attitudes to fit
		the circumstances.



	\item The second group is again nicely described by Tigard as cases
		\say{where the circumstances are normal but the agent is
		abnormal} (\cite[p.5]{Tigard_2020}). Strawson speaks of children
		or schizophrenics or people that act out of compulsion
		(\cite[p.8-9]{Strawson1962}). Such
		agents cannot be appropriate targets of reactive attitudes
		because the expectations upon which the reactive attitudes are
		based cannot be reasonably targeted towards them. According to
		Strawson, it is unreasonable to expect moral behaviour from
		someone who is morally deranged or underdeveloped. In this
		sense, they are not moral agents and cannot be treated as such.
		We do not see them as members of the moral community
		(\cite[p.18]{Strawson1962}). The attitudes we exhibit towards
		them differ accordingly compared to those who are members of the
		moral community. We see them as \say{object[s] of social policy;
			as [...] subject[s] for [...] treatment; as something
			certainly to be taken account, perhaps precautionary
			account, of; to be managed or handled or cured or
		trained; perhaps simply to be avoided [...]}
		(\cite[p.8]{Strawson1962}). Seeing an agent as such, implies
		that we portray a second set of attitudes towards them. Strawson
		calls these attitudes \textit{objective attitudes}
		(\cite[p.9]{Strawson1962}). 
\end{enumerate}

I want to reiterate: To have reactive attitudes towards someone \textit{means}
to view them as a fully responsible agent. In Strawson's eyes these are the same
things (\cite[p.23]{Strawson1962}). To have objective attitudes towards someone (or something)
\textit{means} to view them outside of the moral community and, thus, to view
them as an inadequate target for ascribing responsibility. \#foreshadowing\\

\subsubsection{Smith}

 I already have repeadetly used such phrasings as `inadequate target' or
 `appropriate object' of moral responsibility or reactive attitudes or blame or
 praise. However, the attentive reader will find that Strawson's account of our
 moral practices focuses strongly on our external perceptions of other's
 internal attitudes.

 In this regard, we are prone to say, that someone is an
 appropriate object of, for example, blame, if (1) we see them as a member of the moral
 community (we can develop reactive attitudes towards them) and (2) we
 \textit{interpret} their attitudes as malevolent or indifferent towards us. But what
 about the cases where our interpretation is wrong? We might think their action
 is an expression of ill will towards us, but by looking beneath their sculp, we
 might see that it is actually not the case and we had misinterpreted their
 attitude. Intuitively, it would not be fair to blame someone, if their \textit{real}
 attitude would not correspond with our \textit{perception} of their attitude.
 Or their action was subject to circumstances unbeknownst to us. We hold them
 responsible and blame them for the action. But upon learning more about the
 circumstances we change our mind and judge the person to be not responsible
 anymore. In fact, we say that they have not been responsible at all even for the
 time we thought they were responsible. Does this not show that there is a sense
 of being responsible that goes beyond `being held responsible' by others? Does
 this not show that we in general do believe in a kind of responsibility relies
 less on our perception and more on the truth of the situation? 
 Smith argues that there is a difference in being held responsible and 
 \textit{being} responsible. And it would not be fair for us to hold someone
 responsible, if they `in reality' are not responsible (\cite[p.
 472]{Smith_2007}).\\




% \textit{Oh hey what is that? I think that is determinism creeping in the
%	 background! Oh no, I hope nobody will notice it! *MISCHA USES HIS
% SPECIAL ATTACK: \textbf{GLOSSING OVER STUFF THAT MIGHT BE VERY IMPORTANT}*}\\
%
% \textit{Can you feel it's presence? It is still at distance, yet comes closer the more we
% seek for truth. It regards us patiently as it is the end boss and it waits for
% a fight that may never halt. And the fight might never halt; not because we are

% is the basis of the words you read, I shall continue to ignore this final
% question and move on. And I ask the same of you. With the words of the russian
% writer Mikhail Bulgakov: Follow me, reader!}

 I believe, Strawson would answer to this, that his account of our moral practices
 does not claim to be fair or fulfill all the demands we might have towards said
 practices. Nor is it necessarily internally consistent. In this sense, it is
 not normative but largely descriptive. In practice, when blaming someone, we do
 not distinguish between our percetion of their attitude and their \textit{real}
 one. I suspect, that even if Strawson would acknowledge the differnce
 between being held responsible and being responsible, he would say that the
 latter notion has no practical relevance in our moral practices.

 We can take Strawsons account of responsibility as a description for when
 people are \textit{held} responsible in Smiths sense. But how does Smith then
 make sense people \textit{being} responsible? She proposes an approach, which
 she calls the rational relations view CITE.

 According to Smith, to be responsible for an action, attitude or mental state,
 one must have a specific connection to it
 %we hold people responsible for actions, attitudes and
 %mental states that they have a specific type of connection to 
 (\cite[p 370]{smith2008control}). What is this connection? The connection
 cannot be that the action, attitude or mental state is attributable to me. I am
 not responsible for feeling hungry, a person with epilepsy is not responsible
 for having seizures, even though these are a things that can
 properly be attributed to me and Epilepsy-Eric (\cite[p.
 584]{smith2012attributability}). Thus, we are not responsible for everything
 that is attributable to us. One might now come up with the idea that we are
 responsible for our conscious choices, but Smith argues that the condition of
 volition does not satisfyingly cover the domain of responsibility.  We might be
 responsible for actions and attitudes we deliberatly choose to take or have,
 but in general we can also be responsible for actions and attitudes that are
 not deliberate but spontaneous and involuntary. An example that Smith brings up
 is her forgetting her friends birthday. She did not choose to forget the
 birthday, she did not undergo a thought process that weighed the pros and cons
 of forgetting the birthday and then arrived at the conclusion that it would
 make sense to ignore the birthday. It just happened. She called her friend as
 soon as she remembered congratulated her and apologised for forgetting. Of
 course her friend forgave her but the implicite assumption still was that
 Smith was responsible for forgetting the birthday. In general, people are also
 considered responsible for their emotional reactions and arguably these are not
 subject to deliberate choice. One could argue now that, if not choice, control
 is what makes someone respnsible. And by control I mean that a person has the
 theoretical control over the things they are doing, perhaps through past
 choices, perhaps through the ability to change a certain aspect of oneself in
 the future. After all, Smith had the control to write down her friends birthday
 in her calendar and install a reminder and she has the control over making sure
 that such a thing will not happen again. This is akin to Matthias' control
 requirement (\cite[p.175]{Matthias_2004}) that we have already introduced in
 the first section. For Smith, this account, though plausible, is not satisfying
 (\cite[p. 251]{smith2005responsibility}). Because what we find bad is not the
 fact that Smith did not take any measures to be reminded of her friends birthday,
 but rather that her forgetting her friends birthday shows (on the surface) that
 Smith does not value her friend enough to remember it. The assumption is that
 if Smith had judged the friendship to be important enough, she would have had
 thought of that significant date.

% PERHAPS IT IS A GOOD IDEA TO PUT THIS IN AND EXPLAIN WHY SHE THINKS THAT
% Smith says that \say{[w]hen we praise
%	 or criticize someone for an attitude it seems we are responding to
% something about the content of that attitude and not to facts about its origin
% in a person's prior voluntary choices, or to facts about its susceptibility to
% influence though a person's future voluntary choices.} (\cite[p.
% 251]{smith2005responsibility}). An account of responsiblility that only relies
% on control 
%
% That control may be a common factor among
% the actions and attitudes we are responsible for, does not go to the heart of
% our moral practices. 

 These kinds of judgements are the basis of Smith's rational relations view.
% THE TRANSITION DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE
%Instead Smith proposes that we are responsible for those things, for which it
%is reasonable to ask us to defend ourselves, or, to use Smith's words, for
%which we are answerable (\cite[p. 251]{smith2005responsibility}). 
 Let us examine how she develops her idea.

 According to Smith, people make certain judgements of \say{value, importance,
 or significance} (\cite[p. 251]{smith2005responsibility}). These
 \textit{evaluative judgements} can be abstract and form individual normative
 ideals, like valuing freedom more than security, or they can be more concrete
 like judging spiders to be dangerous. The judgements people make should
 \textit{rationally}\footnote{I find that Smith uses the word
	 \say{rational} in a very loose sense. She probably does not mean
	 rational in the idealised and logical way, but rather in a more
	 holisitc sense. If my interpretation is correct the word
 \say{reason-giving} as it is used by Shoemaker is a bit more
 fitting (\cite[p. 23]{Shoemaker_2011}).} lead to certain behaviour in accordance with the
 judgements (\cite[p. 244, p. 247, p. 250]{smith2005responsibility}). Thus, the
 attitudes and actions are a direct reflection of evaluative judgements. Smith
 argues, if a persons behaviour is based on such an
 evaluative judgement, they are \say{open, in principle, to demands for
 justification} for their behaviour (\cite[p.
 577-578]{smith2012attributability}). This is what she calls
 \textit{answerability}. So, people are answerable for their behaviour, if they
 are theoretically able to reference a judgement that the behaviour was
 expressing and to defend and justify that judgement. Further,
 she states that moral appraisal of an agent \say{always embodies (at least implicitly) a
 demand to her to justify herself} (\cite[p. 578]{smith2012attributability}).

 Let us now connect all the dots: Being responsible is being open for moral
 appraisal. Moral appraisal \textit{always} encompasses demands of justification. Such
 demands only make sense, if a person is answerable for the appraised action or
 attitude, meaning \say{that the thing in question must in some way reflect [the
 persons] judgement or assessent of reasons} (\cite[p.
 103]{smith2015responsibility}). According to Smith, people are responsible for
 all and only those things, for which they are also answerable (\cite[p. 251,
 p.256]{smith2005responsibility}).



% The people can then be asked to justify their behaviour and they
% can answer with a reference to and a justification of their judgement. Smith
% says that the people are \textit{answerable} for their behaviour, if 


 An important property of these
 \textit{evaluative judgements} is, that they must not \textit{necessarily} be
 on the conscious radar or arrived at though deliberate thought. They can also
 be sponataneous judgements that the person only forms or discovers when being
 confronted with a new situation (\cite[p. 251-252]{smith2005responsibility}).

 \begin{example}
	 Melissa has never thought much about her becoming a victim of sexual
	 assult. It is not a topic that crosses her mind in general. One night
	 she walks home through a dark alley and she spots a man walking
	 behind her. To her own surprise, she finds herself being afraid of that
	 man. The fear makes Melissa walk faster with the hope of getting more
	 distance between her and the man and getting home faster.
 \end{example}

 In the example, we see Melissa discovering her judgement that a man can
 be potentially dangerous to her. The judgement arises sponatneously without her
 having thought much about forming it and it elicits certain attitudes
 and actions in Melissa. She experiences fear and walks faster because of it.
 Notice also that Melissa's judgement is open to critical assessment; As soon as
 she is aware of her judgement she has the possibility to think about the
 judgement and decide whether it is justified or not.
 Now, according to Smith, there is a rational relation between Melissa's
 judgement and her attitudes and actions. Melissa's actions and attitudes are
 expressions and reflections of her judgements. Melissa can thus justify her behaviour
 by referencing and defending the evaluative judgements that caused it. She is
 answerable for her behaviour. And that is what makes her responsible for it.

% So when Smith says that a person is answerable for something, she means that
% the person is in some way expressing an evaluative judgement and it is
% reasonable to ask them to rationally\footnote{I find that Smith uses the word
%	 \say{rational} in a very loose sense. She probably does not mean
%	 rational in the idealised and logical way, but rather in a more
%	 holisitc sense. If my interpretation is correct the word
% \say{reason-giving} as it is used by Shoemaker is a bit more
% fitting (\cite[p. 23]{Shoemaker_2011}).} defend that judgement. The defence is
% then the basis for their appraisal.  And, on Smith'S account, people are
% responsible for all and only those things, for which they are answerable.

 To summarise:
 When we think that someone is morally responsible for something, we
 \textit{might} demand a justification for their conduct before we
 appraise them. The assumption is that their conduct is a direct result of their
 explicit or implicit judgement. Our appraisal is then formed on the basis of
 their justification for their judgement or, in other words, their answer to our
 demand. If it is reasonable to make such a demand for justification the person
 is said to be answerable. And according to Smith, people are responsible (open
 to moral appraisal) for all and only those things they are answerable for.

% Some of the actions we take and the attitudes we adopt are rooted in
% judgements
% about the world, other people and ourselves. They can be judgements of
% prefence, value, significance and belief. They can be the result of
% deliberate thinking, but they might also arise spontaneously. Such judgements
% can be critically assessed by their holder as well as by other moral agents.
% Because of that, we can say that 
%
% These judgements express themselves in our actions and attitudes.
%
%
%
% answerability is just the condition for responsibility.
%
% This is what Smith means when she talks about \textit{answerability}. 
% Being responsible for an action or attitude, on Smith's account, is 
% being answerable for the underlying evaluative judgement. Further, we are
% responsible for all and only those actions and attitudes that can reasonably
% said to have an evaluative judgement as a basis for them. This rules out being
% responsible for having hunger or seizures.
% One is
% answerable for their actions and attitudes, if they are grounded in an
% evaluative judgement that rationally should elicit them.
%
%
% Actions, attitudes and mental states that
% express such evaluative judgements are exactly what we are responsible for.

% (\cite{Shoemaker_2011}). DA SHOE tries to give an account of what it means to

% Answerability, Attributability and Accountability.
%
% By Answerability Shoemaker means that people are responsible (i.e. open for moral

%In light of Strawsons refusal to see moral responsibility as a metaphysical

\section{Can we Bridge the Gap?}

The story sofar:\\
We have defined moral responsibility to be an openess for moral appraisal.
Matthias says that to be morally responsible for something, one must be in
control of it. According to Strawson, the way we blame and praise other people
is based on a social negotiation, based on actions, intentions, attitudes and
reactions. Smith goes a bit further and tries to give a more rigorous account of
the conditions to moral responsibility. She says that people are responsible for
all and only those things that are rationally caused by a preceding evaluative
judgement. Let us now turn back to the responsibility gap, as it is described
above. Matthias claims that there is a responsibility gap, because it is not
clear how to ascribe responsibility for actions performed by intelligent
autonomous systems. The problem is that new intelligent autonomous technologies
act more and more without human control and supervision, but can still have
morally relevant impacts. Though Matthias makes this claim on the basis of the
control requirement, I suspect that what makes us wonder about the
ascription of responsibility is our moral intuition and not any sophisticated
philosophical explanation of our moral practices. We see the new technology and
understand that it is different from anything else that humanity has produced
and we ask the question \say{How do we deal with this?} And specifically we
wonder, who is responsible when a machine causes any harm?
Our inability, insecurity or hesitation to answer this question is exactly what
the responsibility gap denotes.
This question can be
asked regardless of the philosophical account of moral responsibility one
supports, but it may be that depending on the account the answers can vary
widely. In \say{Killer Robots}, Sparrow assesses the ethics of autonomous
weapon systems and what happens when they commit something that would be
considered a war crime. Who would be responsible for it? According to Sparrow
there are three sensible cadidates to ascribe responsibility to: The programmer,
the commanding officer and the machine itself. This seems to me like a fair
account even beyond autonomous robot warfare. It seems that the three targets
(programmer, user, machine) are intuitively where to look for responsibility.

\subsection{Can machines be responsible?}
Arguably, if machines cannot be responsible, we do not need to divert from
instrumentalism and deal with the stuff just like we have dealt with it in the
past.

The question of can machines be responsible can be answered in four different
ways: Yes, No, Maybe and Kinda

\subsubsection{Machines cannot be responsible}
Who says that and why?

Sparrow: Machines, how ever autonomous they are, cannot suffer, thus they cannot
properly be held responsible.
Sparrow acknowledges that a machine can be causally responsible for some action,
but denies its ability to be morally responsible. To be morally responsible is to be
open to moral appraisal (blame or praise). To receive these treatments one must
be able to 


\textbf{Johnson: Machines cannot be full moral agents bla bla, I am not sure what she
says}
\textbf{Bryson: Robots should be slaves. Otherwise we will use them to evade
responsibility}
\textbf{Marino/Tamburrini: Implicit neglection of the option}
\textbf{Champagne/Tokens: Implicit neglection of the option}

\subsubsection{Machines can be responsible}
Discuss artificial agency
\textbf{Tigard: different types of responsibility}
\textbf{Coeckelberg: It all depends on what position in society they will have.}
\textbf{Smith/Vickers: Machines can only be responsible, if they are conscious and their
morality is similar to ours}

\textbf{Sullins: Robots can be functionally responsible. If the only way to make sense
of a robots behaviour is to ascribe some responsibility to it, then it is
responsible.}

Sullins approach is a bit different insofar as he says that being able to be
responsible is a precondition for the machine to be an autonomous agent, not the
other way around. He writes that a robot can be responsible, if ascribing responsiblity to it
is the best way to explain it's behaviour. For Sullins assuming responsibility
comes from a `belief' of duty to do something. This belief must not originate
from something we might call consciousness or a thought. As he cynically
remarks: \say{The machine may have no claim to consciousness, [...], or any of
	the other
	somewhat philosophically dubious entities we ascribe to human
specialness}(\cite[p. 159]{sullins2006robots}).
`Belief' is a functional term
to describe something that motivates one to solve moral problems in a certain
way (\cite[p. 159]{sullins2006robots}).

\section{Discussion}
War robots are bad? We want the moral cost and risc be very high.

The authors talk about responsibility for actions and attitudes but there is
very little talk about responisbility for consequences, which seems even more
important in the context of AI.

In some cases we need to decide what our moral obligation is. Is it more moral
to create a system, where noone is really morally responsible, but there are
much less bad outcomes because machines perform better than humans (e.g.
autonomous vehicles) or is it so important that we can find moral responsibility
in such cases that we cannot turn to such a system
\section{Conclusion}
\section{Disclaimers}
Put this in the beginning or even better into the introduction

Blame and praise are asymmetrical in how we pay attentio to them . While it
might be an interesting intellectual execise to think about who deserves credit
for a piece of art produced by a machine learning algorithm the question of
responsiblity seems far more pressing for when an automated car runs over a
pedestrian or a medical software misdiagnoses a patient. I will thus, mostly
restrict my search for responsibility to cases in which we want to blame.
